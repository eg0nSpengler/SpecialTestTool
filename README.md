# Special Test Tool

### You'll have to excuse the name, while I don't condone cheating I made this tool for someone to assist them in their studies.

# Dependencies

## pytesseract
## openai-python 
## PyQt6
## A screenshot tool (I tested this with ShareX)


# How it works

I'll write a more lengthy explanation later but it works like this

Take screenshot of question using screenshot tool -> parse text from screenshot using pytesseract -> make API call to openai with the question -> return answer according to the prompt defined in tool_funcs.py
